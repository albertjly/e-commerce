# **E-commerce Back-end**


>## **_Description_**

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. 

The challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. To take a working Express.js API and to configure it for using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
